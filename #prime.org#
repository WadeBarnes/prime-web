  Goal: Track engagement and sessions.
  Can't accurately track per-PERSON, as can be multiple people demoing on the same machine (same IP).

** Deploy Changes - OpenShift issues
Cause seemed to be nginx.conf referencing captcha service which doesn't exist.  Trying ne wbuild now.


Changes - had deleted a bunch of broken deployments (prime-dev > deployments). 
	- Left pipelines alone, didn't delete any

BUG:

    --> Scaling up prime-web-88 from 0 to 2, scaling down prime-web-83 from 2 to 0 (keep 2 pods available, don't exceed 3pods)
	Scaling prime-web-88 up to 1
    error: timed out waiting for any update progress to be made


* OAuth / Authentication
  
- keycloak :: identity broker in OpenShift - https://www.keycloak.org/

** Meetings
*** 11/07/2018 -  Review Prime Registration SA
/Reviewing OAuth architecture and planning POC in OpenShift/

- going to be integrating Keycloak with our MAXIMUS services
- the BCSC OAuth server it'll talk to is not yet setup (we can still configure our app to talk to keycloak)
- one technical issue: account has to be created before 2fa token, so we may have to create accounts (u/p) earlier in process

**** TODO Next week setup Keycloak to test proof of concept


*** 02/04/2019 -  UX Design Overview (Farzad)

Begin on bundle 1 shortly with kristin.

Cards referenced: https://gcpe-mygovbc-msp-demo.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/demo/index.html
- entire card is clickable
- also have a BLUE 'continue/register' button, that's a redundancy and helps with screen readers.
- card or button clicked
- cards will also need some "flip" to show their back for some of them (e.g. on forgot your password). Doesn't have to flip, but some animation to change content.


* Prime Development
** Project Start

Use 'ng new' as basis, and 'ng-add'+ a schematic to configure the project (Backup plan: just pre-make a folder and put it in the Git repo subfolder to clone).

'ng add' schematic -
https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/src/lib/schematics/ng-add/index.ts (also look at parent folder)




*** New Project Requirements
**** TODO Loading new package.json deps (edit file or just have an 'npm install <xxx> --save' step?)
- mygovbc-bootstrap-theme

**** TODO Importing CSS (edit style.scss)
**** TODO Starter page, super simple with example styles.

**** TODO Commit new project to new branch in prime folder
** DONE Get Cristina estimates - high/med/low complex blocks and then assign the blocks
   CLOSED: [2019-02-19 Tue 18:27]
next couple days, do with Kristin who is booking a room tomorrow afternoon.
*** DONE Get estimate spreadsheet from Jam. In email archive, found.

March 6th - MoH-Registration in OpenShift dev for TEST
March 12th - MoH-Registration in OpenShift Dev for MoH review!
April 11th - MoH-Registration end-to-end (e.g. file uploads)

From: "PRIME - 2019 CIA Estimate - Dev.xlsx" (Cristina)


## Tech Spec
http://maxnetbc/IT/Projects/PRIME/Shared%20Documents/Forms/Project%20View.aspx?RootFolder=%2FIT%2FProjects%2FPRIME%2FShared%20Documents%2F07%20-%20Build&View=%7BC8E0E436-531A-4533-8264-5CDB482C5774%7D&InitialTabId=Ribbon%2EDocument&VisibilityContext=WSSTabPersistence

SharePoint > Build > Registration > Messages - contains JSON schema, examples, and request diagrams for each request.


**** TODO Add OpenShift pathfinder link to "PRIME Registration Technical Specs.docx" (SharePoint, Cristina)

*** Prime Dev Status - Feb 28th 2019

JIRA - Releases have been setup as Sprints by Cristina. 
Note - the dates are for MoH delivery, so we need a week beforehand for TEST to run.
First sprint done for TEST by end of next week (Friday)

Following sprint includes end-to-end, file uploader, cache-service, CAPTCHA (ng7 compat).

Devs (Kristin and I) will be responsible for accessability from now on. Not Farzad.

*** Prime - DESIGN MEETING - JSON Messages Structures / Schemas - Inline Validation

Messages in FDS

regStatusCode has 3 types:

0 = success
1 = error
2 = warning

0 is success, advance to next stage
1 is a serious exception. handle it the same way as if we didn't get a resonse from the server at all. e.g. oracle db is down
2 is a warning (like a 400 status code), e.g maybe the user's email is not unique

## Cache-Service

multiple REST endpoints from cache-service, endpoints can include query params.
    e.g. '/getMessages,/getSecurity?app=prime'

we're going to use one endpoint with multiple different params ('/getCache?type=secureQs,/getCache?type=docTypes') - this is the way we're going. limits total endpoints


## Deployments / Schedules

We need a whole new OpenShift project, as we're going to have entirely separate apps for Registratoin, Enrollment, etc.
Separate git repos, separate everything - (makes the moh-common-lib super important)

## New Team Members 

New team members on PRIME: Sean, and potentially also Abhi. We're going to request Sean, via Jam.


*** Prime Dev Status - March 7th 2019

Lots of project documentation in Confluence, including decision log and gantt trees
https://devtools.maximusbc.ca/confluence/display/PRID/Project+Documentation
**** DONE - Request access to Confluence
     CLOSED: [2019-03-08 Fri 13:20]
- emailed Evgeny, waiting on response

**** DONE Deploy new build to DEV before lunch today
     CLOSED: [2019-03-08 Fri 13:20]
Going to be meeting with TEST in the afternoon to do a general walkthrough
- text mask issues, ie bugfix, etc. 
- potentially need new moh-common-lib publish 


**** TODO Need ability to change different backends that frontend points too (JIRA-ize)
- will trigger a new pipeline build as it requires nginx.conf changes
? unless we potentially add a new route, e.g. /api/ goes to one, and /api-backup/ goes to another.


**** TODO see about old prime app being on github-pages
- removes need for Jam to have new openshift env just to show the pages
- emailed Jam



**** TODO add dev only screen notification

**** TODO change result page - remove error text - ocpy paste from fpc

**** TODO grey out postal code for BCSC

**** TODO Do a WAZE run, get Kristin to look at it. I can do core components.
