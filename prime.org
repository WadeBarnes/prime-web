* Logging - Splunk
  Goal: Track engagement and sessions.
  Can't accurately track per-PERSON, as can be multiple people demoing on the same machine (same IP).

** Deploy Changes - OpenShift issues
Cause seemed to be nginx.conf referencing captcha service which doesn't exist.  Trying ne wbuild now.


Changes - had deleted a bunch of broken deployments (prime-dev > deployments). 
	- Left pipelines alone, didn't delete any

BUG:

    --> Scaling up prime-web-88 from 0 to 2, scaling down prime-web-83 from 2 to 0 (keep 2 pods available, don't exceed 3pods)
	Scaling prime-web-88 up to 1
    error: timed out waiting for any update progress to be made


* OAuth / Authentication
  
- keycloak :: identity broker in OpenShift - https://www.keycloak.org/

** Meetings
*** 11/07/2018 -  Review Prime Registration SA
/Reviewing OAuth architecture and planning POC in OpenShift/

- going to be integrating Keycloak with our MAXIMUS services
- the BCSC OAuth server it'll talk to is not yet setup (we can still configure our app to talk to keycloak)
- one technical issue: account has to be created before 2fa token, so we may have to create accounts (u/p) earlier in process

**** TODO Next week setup Keycloak to test proof of concept


*** 02/04/2019 -  UX Design Overview (Farzad)

Begin on bundle 1 shortly with kristin.

Cards referenced: https://gcpe-mygovbc-msp-demo.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/demo/index.html
- entire card is clickable
- also have a BLUE 'continue/register' button, that's a redundancy and helps with screen readers.
- card or button clicked
- cards will also need some "flip" to show their back for some of them (e.g. on forgot your password). Doesn't have to flip, but some animation to change content.


* Prime Development
** Project Start

Use 'ng new' as basis, and 'ng-add'+ a schematic to configure the project (Backup plan: just pre-make a folder and put it in the Git repo subfolder to clone).

'ng add' schematic -
https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/src/lib/schematics/ng-add/index.ts (also look at parent folder)




*** New Project Requirements
**** TODO Loading new package.json deps (edit file or just have an 'npm install <xxx> --save' step?)
- mygovbc-bootstrap-theme

**** TODO Importing CSS (edit style.scss)
**** TODO Starter page, super simple with example styles.

**** TODO Commit new project to new branch in prime folder
** TODO Get Cristina estimates - high/med/low complex blocks and then assign the blocks
next couple days, do with Kristin who is booking a room tomorrow afternoon.
*** DONE Get estimate spreadsheet from Jam. In email archive, found.
